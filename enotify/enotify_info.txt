Event Notify plugin
*******************
This plugin notifies you about message, URL, file, authorization request and "You were added" events.

You can customize the appearance of the popup
(M->Options->Events->Popup appearance)
and the triggering options
(M->Options->Events->Notifying)

Left click on popup:	open the specific window

Right click on popup:	close


A value of 0 seconds disables the timer removing the popups, so you have to click them.

The preview of the event is shown as tooltip.

I'd like to thank hrk who supported me while coding this plugin
and for the popup-styles of his NewStatusNotify plugin (as you
might have seen). Thanks a lot!
